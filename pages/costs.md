The indicative costs for boats, races, on-board packet lunches, prizegiving
ceremony (excl. the dinner), and welcome party varies from 2273 Euro/boat, with
a crew of 5 members if we have 15 boats/75participants, to 2545 euro/boat if we
have 10 boat/50 participants. The cost of the social dinner on Saturday is
on-top and above of these figures (indicative range 30-50 euro/pax TBC).

The deposit for damages, to be returned after the check-out, is 500 euro/boat
(on top and above cost indicated in the paragraph above), including gennaker.
All the boats have an insurance covering civil liability. As far as medical
assistance, participants are recommended either having a personal insurance or
issuing the Spanish sailing licence (at a maximum cost of 57 â‚¬ - that we will
try to reduce) which include coverage for medical assistance.
