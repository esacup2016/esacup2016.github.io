The final price per boat is not fixed yet, negotiations with sponsors are still
ongoing and might reduce the costs for participants.

The final price is expected to not exceed **2900 Euro/boat**. Included in this
price are the boat for a crew of up to five persons, participation in the races,
on-board packet lunches, photos, welcome party, prizegiving ceremony and gala
dinner.

The costs of an optional training day, including instructor (no reduction
possible if bareboat only), is around **700 Euro/boat**. You can book up to two
training days.

The deposit for damages, to be returned after the check-out, is 500 Euro/boat
(on top and above the costs indicated in the paragraphs above), including
gennaker. All boats have an insurance covering civil liability. Regarding
medical coverage, participants are advised to either have a personal insurance
or obtain a Spanish sailing licence (maximum cost of 57 Euro, that we will try to
reduce) which include coverage for medical assistance.
