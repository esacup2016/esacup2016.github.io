The final price per boat is not fixed yet, it depends on the number of
registrations. Moreover, negotiations with sponsors are still ongoing and might
further reduce the costs for participants.

The price is expected to be between about **2600 Euro/boat**, if we have 15
boats/75 participants, and about **2900 Euro/boat**, if we have 10 boats/50
participants. Included in this price are the boat with a crew of up to five
persons, participation in the races, on-board packet lunches, photos, welcome
party, prizegiving ceremony and gala dinner.

The costs of one optional training day, including instructor (no reduction
possible if bareboat only), will be between **658 Euro/boat** (in case of 15
boats) and **737 Euro/boat** (in case of 10 boats). You can book up to two
training days.

The deposit for damages, to be returned after the check-out, is 500 Euro/boat
(on top and above the costs indicated in the paragraphs above), including
gennaker. All boats have an insurance covering civil liability. Regarding
medical coverage, participants are advised to either have a personal insurance
or obtain a Spanish sailing licence (maximum cost of 57 â‚¬, that we will try to
reduce) which include coverage for medical assistance.
