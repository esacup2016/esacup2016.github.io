## Barcelona

Barcelona is the capital city of the autonomous community of Catalonia in Spain
and Spain's second most populated city. Its urban area extends beyond the
administrative city limits with a population of around 4.7 million people, being
the sixth-most populous urban area in the European Union and the largest
metropolis on the Mediterranean Sea.

The city is one of the world's leading tourist, economic, trade fair and
cultural centers, and its influence in commerce, education, entertainment,
media, fashion, science, and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the
world's major global cities.

Founded as a Roman city, Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an
important cultural center and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned
are the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, which
have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is known for hosting
the 1992 Summer Olympics and many other international sport tournaments.

## Port Vell

Port Vell (literally in English 'Old Harbor') is part of the
Port of Barcelona. It was rebuilt as part of an urban renewal program prior to the
1992 Barcelona Olympics. Before this, it was a run-down area of empty
warehouses, railroad yards, and factories. 16 million people visit the complex
each year.

It is now a focal point of the city and tourist attraction, containing the
Maremàgnum (a mall containing shops, a multiplex cinema, bars and restaurants),
IMAX Port Vell and Europe's largest aquarium containing 8000 Fish and 11 sharks
contained in 22 basins filled with 6 million litres of sea water. A pedestrian
walkway, Rambla de Mar, connects La Rambla to Port Vell. It incorporates a swing
bridge, in order to allow ships to enter and exit the harbour.
