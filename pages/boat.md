The International J/80 is a fixed keel One-Design sportsboat certified for offshore sailing, normally crewed by 3 to 5 people. As well as its mainsail & headsail, the J/80 has a 65 mÂ² gennaker for downwind sailing, which when the wind rises over 15 knots gets the boat on the plane downwind.

With over 1300 J/80's worldwide, the J/80 is one of Europe's and North America's best selling sportsboats. Recognized by the ISAF, the International J/80 Class Association promotes activities and regattas worldwide. For class racing, sails are restricted to only a main, headsail and gennaker with total crew weight at 338.6 kg with no limit on crew numbers.

According to Sailing World Magazine, "The J/80 is easier to handle, less intimidating, safer and better suited for sailing offshore than other modern sport boats tested."

The J/80 is the only sportsboat to be certified for Design Category 'B' of the EU Recreational Craft Directive, which means it can withstand waves that are 4 metres high and in winds up to 41 knots. This gives the J/80 a reputation of being a very well built boat for its size, capable of extreme weather conditions.

Due to the J/80 having an asymmetrical spinnaker with a retractable bowsprit, there is little clutter on the deck and in the cockpit, giving the crew more space and fewer tripping hazards on board.
