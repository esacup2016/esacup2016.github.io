Barcelona is a very popular destination, especially in May. It is recommended to
fix travel and accommodation arrangements as soon as possible.

## Travel

Barcelona is easily accessible by plane from all over Europe. Transfer from the
airport to the city can be made by Taxi (ca. 35€) or [public
transport](http://www.tmb.cat/en/acces-aeroport) (ca. 8€).

If you stay at the NH Hotel Barcelona Eixample (see
[Accommodation](#accommodation) below), just take the Aerobus A1 or A2, which
runs every 15 minutes from 6:00 a.m. to midnight. Leave this bus at the stop
*Gran Via - Comte Borrell*, which is just a few minutes walking distance from the
hotel.
