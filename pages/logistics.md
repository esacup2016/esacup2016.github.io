Barcelona airport is easily accessible from all over Europe. Transfer to the city can be made by Taxi (ca. 30€) or public transport (ca. 8€).

Preliminary block booking has been made at [NH Hotel Barcelona Centro](http://www.nh-hotels.it/hotel/nh-barcelona-centro) for 30 rooms with double occupancy at rates of 120 euro/night including breakfast (i.e. 60 euro/person/night). The hotel is in walking distance from the Harbour.

Participants are obviously free to select any other hotel they prefer. However, be advised to reserve flights and accommodation as early as possible, as Barcelona is a very popular destination (especially in May).
