Barcelona is a very popular destination, especially in May. It is recommended to
fix travel and accommodation arrangements as soon as possible.

## Travel

Barcelona airport is easily accessible from all over Europe. Transfer to the
city can be made by Taxi (ca. 30€) or [public
transport](http://www.tmb.cat/en/acces-aeroport) (ca. 8€).

If you stay at the NH Hotel Barcelona Centro (see
[Accomomodation](#accommodation) below), just take the Aerobus A1 or A2, which
runs every 15 minutes from 6:00 a.m. to midnight. This bus takes you directly to
Plaça Catalunya, which is just five minutes walking distance from the hotel.

## Accommodation {#accommodation}

Preliminary block booking has been made at [NH Hotel Barcelona
Centro](http://www.nh-hotels.com/hotel/nh-barcelona-centro) for 30 rooms with
